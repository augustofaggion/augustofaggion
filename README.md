### About me
With a solid background in logistics, I have developed strong teamwork skills and expertise in optimizing processes. During my time in this field, I became interested in web and software development. 

Motivated by this interest, I began learning to code on my own and completed the Le Wagon bootcamp as a Full Stack Web Developer. Having finished the course, I am now focused on transitioning to a career in web development and finding a role where I can apply my new skills.
